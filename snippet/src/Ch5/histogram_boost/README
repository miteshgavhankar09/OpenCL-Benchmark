Background Information
========================
This histogram program is taken from the example code in the C++ Boost Libraries hosted at www.boost.org
The program will take an JEPG file conveniently named "test.jpeg" and proceed to dump the information
in the file "out-histogram.txt".

RUN IT
==========
To run it, you need to have both boost + jpeg libs installed as described below. Once that's done, you 
will need to build the program by executing 'make' which will execute the Makefile

./histogram

A file 'out-histogram.txt' will be outputted on the current directory. Depending on your system's configuration,
you may wish to create a symbolic/hard link from <jpeglib dir>/lib/libjpeg to /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.

Extras
==========
You need to download version "1.53.0" of the C++ Boost Libraries from www.boost.org for this example to work
You also need to download version "9" of the C++ JPEG Libraries from http://ijg.org/ too.

Recommendations
================
Its highly recommended to place the boost installation and JPEG libs in your home directory (because they will
install to /usr/local/ by default i.e. system wide). Please read the "Getting Started" page for Boost at 
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html to see how this can be done; for JPEG libs
you can use 

./configure --prefix=<destination directory>

prior to building/installing it.
